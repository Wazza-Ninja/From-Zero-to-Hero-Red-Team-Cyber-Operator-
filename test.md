# Cyber Kill Chain
| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| reconnaissances | The first stage of the cyber kill chain is reconnaissance. In this stage, the attacker is assessing the target from outside of the organization from both a technical and non-technical perspective. In this stage, the attacker is working to determine which targets will return the most benefit for the resources expended in exploiting the target's information systems. The attacker will be looking for information systems with few protections or exploitable vulnerabilities.Active Information Gathering: With active information ***gathering and reconnaissance***, the attacker actively interacts with the target system. An example of active information gathering and reconnaissance is port scanning, where the attacker works to enumerate open ports. The goal of the attacker, in this case, is to uncover ports that are vulnerable to exploitation and therefore would provide a means for the attacker to access the target system. ***Passive Information Gathering***: Passive information gathering and reconnaissance attempt to obtain information related to the target information systems without engaging those information systems directly |
| Weaponization |The second stage of the cyber kill chain is weaponization. During weaponization, the threat actor develops malware specifically crafted to the vulnerabilities discovered during the reconnaissance phase of the cyber kill chain. Based on the intelligence gathered in the reconnaissance phase, the attacker will tailor their toolset to meet the specific requirements of the target network.For example, if a specific vulnerable version of secure shell was discovered, the attacker would build an exploit kit that takes advantage of the vulnerability. The kit will not just focus on the exploitation of vulnerabilities. The kit's design will ensure that the attacker has administrative privileges on the exploited information system so that further actions can be taken on the computer as required. Additionally, if the internet is accessible, the attacker will build in a command-and-control capability allowing full remote access to the exploited information system |
